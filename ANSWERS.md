- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
class compinents are more code but allow for lifecycle hooks 
class comps give us acces to componentDid.... which are more specific in what they do rather than just a generic hook

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
componentDidMount: sets it up to be used 
componentDidUpdate: updates the dom
componentdWillUnmount: component dies

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
It allows you to hook pages/functions by setting a key and an initial value that can be manipulated and passed 

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
testing helps debug code faster, makes code more reliable and makes devs more confident in their code
